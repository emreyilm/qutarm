# qutarm

QUTarm (read: cute arm) is my code for controlling a robotic arm
built from scratch from 3D printed parts, XL-320 servos (by ROBOTIS)
and OpenCM9.04 Arduino compatible micro-controller.  It uses ROS
(Robotic Operating System) for controlling the arm.

## Videos

Here are videos of the robot in motion:
